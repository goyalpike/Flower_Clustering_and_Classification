In this repository, we study unsupervised learning (clustering) and classification problem using the [Flower data set](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/). In this repo, a small subset of the original data is used.

There are three implementations:
* Clustering based approach
  Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
  t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
  Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)
  
* Classification implementation using PyTorch

* Classification implementation using Fastai
